# Logo Component

So. Thanks to SVG filter effects, I can take a black and white WebM video, *with **no** transparency*, and produce a colourized version **with** transparency. Yay!

This is exciting because it will allow me to use more complex animations in the smaller video file but still adjust the colour dynamically.

## What I've learnt so far
- WebM video isn't supported on iOS
