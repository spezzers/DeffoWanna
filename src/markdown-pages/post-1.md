Hello world. It does feel good to be alive!

I wonder if [footnotes](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax#footnotes) work in Gatsby?[^1]

[^1]: Did this footnote work? Yes!

	Yup! *(image from [react-spring](https://react-spring.io/))

> let's **quote** *something* here, yeah? - wisdom  
> ..and add **another** line of wisdom

Wasn't that an interesting quote! I feel so enlightened all of a sudden.

Hmmm, [how does a ridiculously long piece of hyperlink text look when it get's hovered, or focussed, even...](#)


So what happens if the article continues after the footnotes? Defeats the point of ***foot**-notes*, but hey.
